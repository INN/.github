# Responsibly reporting security vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in a software project maintained by INN, there are many ways to contact us without filing a GitHub issue:

- Send an email to support@inn.org: this forwards TKTK
- Send an email to nerds@inn.org: this forwards TKTK, bypassing TKTK
- Send physical mail to TKTK address
